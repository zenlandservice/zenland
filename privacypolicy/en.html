                Privacy Policy
            </h1>
            <h4>
                Last updated: Jan 2, 2024
            </h4>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how we, as the operator of the ZenLand mobile application (the ""App""), collects information when you visit the Site or use the App (separately and collectively, the ""Service"" or ""We""). It also explains how we use and disclose the information we collect from you, and your rights in relation to that information. By accessing, visiting or using the Service, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that if you disagree with anything in this Privacy Policy, you must not use the Service.
            </p>

            <h5>
                1. REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
            </h5>
            <p>
                Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We will notify users of changes to this Privacy Policy by posting the amended terms on the Site or Service in advance of the last updated date of the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, you should discontinue your use of the Site or Service before the modified privacy policy takes effect. If you continue using the Site or Service after the modified privacy policy takes effect, you will be bound by the modified privacy policy.
            </p>

            <h5>
                2. COLLECTING INFORMATION
            </h5>
            <p>
                Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
            </p>

            <h5>
                2.1 Account Information
            </h5>
            <p>
                If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your email address (""PII""). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your Social Networking Sites (the ""SNS"") Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Services or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.
            </p>

            <h5>
                2.2 Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies
            </h5>
            <p>
                Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information. ""Cookies"" are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties. ""Web Beacons"" (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).
            </p>

            <h5>
                2.3 Information Related to Use of the Services
            </h5>
            <p>
                Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as ""Log Data""), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a ""User""). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.
            </p>

            <h5>
                2.4 Information Sent by Your Mobile Device
            </h5>
            <p>
                We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.
            </p>

            <h5>
                3. SHARING OF DATA
            </h5>
            <p>
                We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:
            </p>

            <h5>
                3.1 Information Shared with Our Services Providers
            </h5>
            <p>
                We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf. We may also share your PII except with our marketing service providers to help us better market our products and services to you. Our marketing service providers may use your PII only for the purpose of helping us better market our products and services to you and are prohibited from transferring your PII to others.
            </p>

            <h5>
                4. YOUR RIGHTS
            </h5>
            <p>
                Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.<br><br>
                Interstitial ads or ads that interrupt or block the user experience will clearly indicate that they are an ad, will not manipulate or trick users into tapping into them, and will provide easily accessible and visible close/skip buttons large enough for users to easily dismiss the ad.<br><br>
                If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected. You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law.<br><br>
                If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, We retain your Personal Data as long as needed to provide services or products to you, or as required or permitted by applicable laws, such as tax and accounting laws.

            <h5>
                4.1 Opt-Out
            </h5>
            <p>
                We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to ""opt-out"". We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.
            </p>

            <h5>
                5. THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
            </h5>
            <p>
                We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.
            </p>

            <h5>
                6. CHILDREN‘S PRIVACY
            </h5>
            <p>
                Children are not eligible to use our services and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. If you are a minor, you can use the service only in conjunction with your parents or guardians. If we are aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files. We use your email address and, in rare situations your mailing address or phone number, to contact you regarding administrative notices from time to time.
